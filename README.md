# DenseNet121-GradCAM-LIME

**DeepLearning with XAI.ipynb** shows the implementation of InceptionV3, ResNet18, VGG16 and DenseNet121. For the chosen DenseNet121 model, Grad-CAM and LIME are employed. 

**gradcam1.py** contains the code for Grad-CAM.

**main.py** contains the streamlit code for running the Dashboard for XAI System with Grad-CAM and LIME on pneumonia images. You need to manually save and load a densenet_model.pth as it is not provided in this repo due to size limit.


**Below shows the dashboard of the XAI system where u can input pneumonia files and obtain the XAI visualization**
